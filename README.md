## About me

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; align-items: start; justify-content: center">
    <div style=" width: calc(100%-310px);">
        <p>I am a computer scientist and software developer with more than 5 years of experience in the market, passionate about technology and the constant challenges it provides. I focus on backend development with a broad repertoire and knowledge in different areas, tools and programming languages.</p>
        <p>My journey in the world of technology is marked by curiosity and self-education, where I acquired much of my knowledge, carrying out my own research in order to deeply understand the concepts behind each tool I apply in my daily life. This approach allows me to face and overcome challenges creatively and efficiently.</p>
        <p>In addition to being a developer, I am a multi-instrumental musician as a hobby, and through this I learned the importance of practice and dedication, both in music and programming. I'm also a big fan of cinema, and the stories I find on screen often inspire me, in some way, both creatively and in my quest to explore new ways of solving problems professionally.</p>
        <p>I am always looking for new challenges, aiming to acquire new experiences, grow professionally and contribute to the advancement of technology as a whole.</p>
